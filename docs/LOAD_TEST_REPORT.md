### Test Script Code (Proof of Actual Testing)
```bash
# Key steps from backend/load-test-10-users.sh (pick + unpick workflow)

bulk_picking_user() {
  # Login and capture JWT
  curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/login" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d "{\"username\":\"$USERNAME\",\"password\":\"$PASSWORD\"}"

  # 1) Search available runs (NEW status)
  curl -s "$BASE_URL/bulk-runs/available" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

  # 2) Fetch form data for ingredient 0 (captures item_key/row_num/line_id)
  curl -s "$BASE_URL/bulk-runs/${RUN_NO}/form-data?ingredient_index=0" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

  # 3) FEFO lot search (paginated) using extracted item key
  curl -s "$BASE_URL/bulk-runs/${RUN_NO}/lots/search?item_key=${ITEM_KEY}&page=1&page_size=5" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

  # 4) Confirm ingredient selection + fetch row/line
  curl -s "$BASE_URL/bulk-runs/${RUN_NO}/next-ingredient" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

  # 5) Pick + Unpick (tests 6-table transaction and rollback)
  curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/bulk-runs/${RUN_NO}/confirm-pick" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" ...
  curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/bulk-runs/${RUN_NO}/${ROW_NUM}/${LINE_ID}/unpick" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
